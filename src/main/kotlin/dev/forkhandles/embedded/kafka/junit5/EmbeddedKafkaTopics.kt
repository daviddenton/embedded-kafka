 * - an instance of [NewTopic]
 * - a [String] (indicating the topic name)
 * - a [Collection] of the above
 *
 * If the return value of this method is a string, or a collection of strings (containing just the topic names),
 * the `numPartitions` and `replicationFactor` parameters are taken from the properties of this annotation.
 *
 * If the annotated method returns [NewTopic], or a collection of [NewTopic]s, the properties of this
 * annotation are ignored.
